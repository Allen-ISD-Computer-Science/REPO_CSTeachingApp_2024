<div><p>OOP otherwise known as object oriented programming can be very beneficial in software development.</p>

<p>Before OOP we had procedural programming, a bunch of data stored in variables and functions operating using that data</p>

<p>The big issue is that the bigger a program grows the more functions it will have resulting in copying lines of code over and over again.</p>

<p>When you made a change in one function, sometimes the other functions would end up breaking.</p>

<p>This is spaghetti code.</p>

<p>OOP fixes all this</p>

<p>how it works is by combining related groups of variables and functions into a "unit"</p>

<p>We call this "unit" an Object</p>

<p>We now refer to the variables in the object as properties and the functions in the object as methods</p>

<p>Take a Ponder: Why do you think this would be better than functions all over the place?</p>

<p>There are four key concepts in OOP</p>

<p>Encapsulation</p>

<p>Abstraction</p>

<p>Inheritance</p>

<p>Polymorphism</p>

<p>Encapsulation </p>

<p>Encapsulation is grouping related variables and functions into objects, simplifying code.</p>

<p>The reason this is so useful is because it allows our functions to have fewer and fewer parameters.</p>

<p>The fewer parameters there are in a function the easier the code becomes to maintain and use</p>

<p>Abstraction</p>

<p>Abstraction hides complex details, making interfaces simpler and changes easier. </p>

<p>A simpler interface means that things will become easier to understand</p>

<p>it can make changes easier because now whenever you change something none of it will impact the rest of the program's code.</p>

<p>This is also known as reducing the impact of change</p>

<p>Inheritance</p>

<p>Inheritance avoids repetition by letting objects inherit properties and methods from others. </p>

<p>instead of defining something every time you have a new element instead you define them once in a generic object and then let the other objects inherit the properties and methods eliminating repetitive code</p>

<p>Polymorphism</p>

<p>Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated similarly, simplifying code further.</p>

<p> It allows you to write code that can work with many different types of objects without knowing their exact type beforehand.</p>

<p>This makes your code more flexible and easier to use.</p>
