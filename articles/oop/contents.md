OOP otherwise known as object oriented programming can be very beneficial in software development.

Before OOP we had procedural programming, a bunch of data stored in varaiables and functions operating using that data

The big issue is that the bigger a program grows the more functions it will have resulting in copying lines of code over and over again.

When you made a change in one functions sometimes the other functions would end up breaking.

This is spagetti code.

OOP fixes all this

how it works is by combining related groups of varables and functions into a "unit"

We call this "unit" an Object

We now refer to the varables in the object as properties adn the functions in the onject as methods

Take a Ponder: Why do you think this would be better than functions all over the place?

There are four key concepts in OOP

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Ingeritance

Polymorphism

Encapsulation is grouping related variables and functions into objects, simplifying code.

The reason this is so useful is because it allows our functions to have fewer and fewer parameters.

The fewers parameters there are in a function the eaiser the code becomes to maintain and use

Abstraction hides complex details, making interfaces simpler and changes easier. 

A simpler interface means that things will become eaiser to understand

it can make changes eaiser because now whenever you change something none of it will impact the rest of the programs code.

This is also known as reducing the impact of change

Inheritance avoids repetition by letting objects inherit properties and methods from others. 

instead of defining something every time you have a new element instead you define them once in a genertic object and then let the other objects inherit the properties and methods elimating repetitive code

Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated similarly, simplifying code further.

 It allows you to write code that can work with many different types of objects without knowing their exact type beforehand.

This makes your code more flexible and easier to use.
