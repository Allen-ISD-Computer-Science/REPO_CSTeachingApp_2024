| File           | Responsive |
|----------------|------------|
| fireworks.html | Yes... (1) |
| home.html      | Yes... (2) |
| index.html     | No!    (3) | 
| question.html  | Yes        |
| results.html   | Yes        |

```
(1) The way things are setup in `questions.html`, The content of the results webpage is displayed.
    So, When the time comes to replace `results.html` with `fireworks.html` this will have to be
    changed.

(2) When the size of the screen is smaller the buttons should be in the center of the screen.

(3) Nothing is responsive about `index.html`. This is especially the case for the Swift Graphic
    Which basically makes the entire `index.html` page look like crap.

    NOTE: Make sure to use 90% mode to get the best look. And use that look to model everything else -
    when we are actually going to fix it.

NOTE: Logo is Rubix font or Inter. I think Rubix font.
