# About Veneficus
The word Veneficus means Wizard in Latin. \
The goal of Veneficus is to teach programming in a "magical" way.

# 🔎 Our Vision

Our vision is to offer a comfortable, informative and inclusive learning experience for CS students.

## 🏡 Comfortability

One of the very things this project seeks to establish is that the students are the ones in control of their learning. And that nothing has consequences unless explicitly consented to. 

*Features such as Unlimited Retakes are prime examples of our commitment to comfortability.*

## 🧑‍🏫 Informativeness

It's critical that you thoroughly explain a concept but it's arguably more critical that things be explained as understandable and simple as possible. 

## 🤝 Inclusivity

A primary goal of this project is to accommodate as many Computer Science students as possible. Everyone should have an equal right to have the same high quality education as everyone else. 

*Features such as Language Translations for articles are a prime example of our commitment to Inclusivity.*

# 👷 Getting Started

## 🐳 Using Docker
You can use docker if you would like.

### 🏗️ Building the docker container
You can build the docker container with these three easy steps.
1. Make sure both the project and docker are installed.
2. Open a Terminal and change your directory to the projects home directory.
3. Build the container using this command `docker build docker -t venfi` (note: this could take a while).

**You only have to do this once.**

### 🏃 Running using the docker container
After you have built the container, we are ready to run it (again in three easy steps).

Run the container with `docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/root/env -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 venfi`.
1. Change your directory to `~/env` *(this should put you in the projects home directoy)*. 
2. Install all required python packages using this command `python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the project using this command `python3.11 main.py`.

*(note: that running with docker may be unstable as we are still testing it)*

## 🧙 Running on CoderMerlin

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Running on CoderMerlin is highly unstable. Read more about it below.

You can run the project on CoderMerlin as well.

### 🚀 Setting up a python virtual env
CoderMerlin does not allow for packages to be natively downloaded. \
To circumvent this we need to use a virtual env. \
You can create one using the following command `python3 -m venv venv`.

### 🏃 Running
After you have setup the virtual env, We are ready to run it (in three easy steps).
1. Enter the virtual env using this command `source venv/bin/activate` (or `$(cat start.sh)`).
2. Install all required python packages using this command `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the project using this command `python3 main.py`.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
Running on CoderMerlin is highly unstable. The reason why is redirects. \
We have tried to fix this issue to no avail. \
Because of this we cannot guarantee that this project will run on CoderMerlin.

## 💻 Running Locally

### 🐍 Install Python 3.10 and 📦 Required Python Packages
To host your own instance of Veneficus, Install Python 3.10 or later.

After that, make sure to install the packages.

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 🏃‍♂ Running
Once you have installed all the required packages which are needed you can proceed to running. \
To do this, Simply run this command `python3 main.py`. \
